# student-directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

In this project I've created a directory that runs via the command line. Depending on the version (lots of experimentation done) users can add, view, load and save student names and other details. In this project I've used arrays, hashes, loops and conditionals. 

## How to use

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
